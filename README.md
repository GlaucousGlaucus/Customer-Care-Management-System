The project is a customer care management system that aims to help businesses improve their interactions with their customers and maintain a good reputation in the eyes of their customers.

  

Customer service is how your company interacts with customers-

-   On a daily basis transactions
    
-   Problem-solving solution when an issue arises.
    

  

It has a direct and a meaningful impact on a company's profit as the customer service serves as a front line response to customers’ needs. And as we meet the customers’ needs we make a happy customer which builds a better reputation and better retention which leads to a higher profit.

The reasons it is so important to have a good customer service is that:

-   It helps to retain customers:
    

-   Keeping your current customers happy generates stable revenue and more accurate predictions.
    

-   Reinforces company values and brand
    

-   As your employees in the customer care department interact with your customers on a regular basis, it is responsible for your brand’s values and mission.
    

-   Good customer care decreases churn
    

-   Churn measures the amount of customers that end up leaving your business after purchasing and this provides negative customer satisfaction which leads to low profits and brings a bad reputation to the company.
    

-   Good customer service brings positive customer reviews
    

-   The better your customer service helps the customer and makes him happy the more recommendations for your business will be made which will attract more customers.
    

-   It increases customer lifetime value
    

-   It represents the total amount of revenue one company can expect to receive from a single customer overtime. An increase in customer lifetime means your customer is spending more money each time they order thereby increasing the revenue of your business.
